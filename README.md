# Project Overview

This project showcases the use of NoSQL technologies and usage of Elastic Stack for comprehensive data processing and visualization.

## Description

The project is divided into two main sections:

1. **NoSQL Technology**: Focuses on MongoDB, where sharding and replication are used to manage large datasets efficiently and ensure high availability.
2. **Elastic Stack**: Utilizes Apache Spark for data processing, with Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana for indexing and visualization.

### üìùAdditional information 

For detailed instructions, refer to the individual README.md files located in the respective directories. Additionally, please pay special attention to the `HOWTO.md` and `README.md` files located in the `results` folder within the Elastic Stack directory for crucial details on setting up and understanding the visualizations.
